        "Last week, we set up a difference model and made causal claims about the effect of minimum wage laws on unemployment. We did this by treating Pennsylvania as a control group for New Jersey on the basis that they had similar trends in unemployment before the minimum wage law, and diverging trends after, and no other shock coincided with this policy.\n",
        "\n",
        "We could still poke some holes in that-- NJ seems to have fared worse than PA after the 2008 crisis; maybe more people work in finance in NJ. Indeed, Jersey City is across the water from Manhattan, America's financial centre. Bankers would be hard hit by a financial crisis, but are probably not that affected by minimum wage laws. Conversely, Pennsylvania is the 3rd largest coal-producing state in the U.S.-- coal miners are probably less affected by financial crises, but more likely to be earning minimum wage. As such, increasing the minimum wage in a place where most people are bankers probably has less of an effect on unemployment compared to an area where everyone is a coal miner.\n",
        "\n",
        "Running a state-level analysis is subject to this sort of selection bias, since by looking at state averages we're effectively comparing places like Jersey City to places like [Centralia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centralia,_Pennsylvania), a coal-mining town in central Pennsylvania which saw its population decline from 1000 in 1980 to just five residents in 2020. So the next step in our analysis might be to try to compare apples to apples. There are a number of ways of doing this-- we could look at the unemployment rate by industry, for example. But what if we didn't want to rely on pre-trends, or if we didn't even have data prior to the treatment? This is often the case\n",
        "\n",
        "To build a more valid counterfactual, we can drill even deeper to find even more similar comparison groups using a **Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD)** using county (rather than state) level data.\n",

        "> **[Regression Discontinuity Designs](https://www.princeton.edu/~davidlee/wp/RDDEconomics.pdf)** are a method of estimating treatment effects in a nonexperimental setting where treatment is determined by whether an observed “assignment” variable exceeds a known cutoff point. If the cutoff is exogenous to the treatment, observations in the vicinity of this cutoff are likely to be very similar, and assignment to the treatment or control group can be considered as good as random.\n",
        "\n",
        "RDD models generally take the following form:\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "In our case, the treatment is the minimum wage law passed in NJ in 2014. We want to be looking at the period after this to pick up on any changes in employment. The **assignment variable** in this case could be the distance of a county to the border between the two states, and the sharp cutoff would be the border itself. Counties on the border counties are probably much more similar to each other than other, farther away counties: this would exclude both Jersey City (in the far east of NJ) and Centralia (in the centre of PA).\n",

From the public policy standpoint, one could argue that we should lower the mortality rate as much as possible.

This would be consistent with the objective of lowering deaths caused by alcohol consumption.\n",

In our example, at the same point in time, some people are just above 21 years and some people are just below 21.

The different-slopes model produces the largest treatment effect, because it allows the relationship between age and the outcome to change at the cutoff. This model also fits the data better, as the interaction term is significant and the slopes clearly differ on each side of the cutoff. Therefore, the linear different-slopes model has the highest treatment effect and provides the best fit."

Another view is that education is simply a signaling mechanism. It just puts you through all these hard tests and academic tasks. If you can make it, it signals to the market that you are a good employee. In this way, education doesn't make you more productive. It only tells the market how productive you have always been. What matters here is the diploma. If you have it, you will be paid more. We refer to this as the **sheepskin effect**, since diplomas were printed in sheepskin in the past.\n",

These students will have very similar human capital, but different signaling credentials. Namely, those that barely passed it, will receive a diploma."

        "As you can see, even when we scale the effect by the first stage, it is still not statistically different from zero. This means that education doesn't increase earnings by a simple sheepskin effect, but rather by increasing one's productivity.\n",

        "## Key Ideas\n",
        "\n",
        "We learned how to take advantage of artificial discontinuities to estimate causal effects. The idea is that we will have some artificial threshold that makes the probability of treatment jump. One example that we saw was how age makes the probability of drinking jump at 21 years. We could use that to estimate the impact of drinking on mortality rate. We use the fact that very close to the threshold, we have something close to a randomized trial. Entities very close to the threshold could have gone either way and what determines where they've landed is essentially random. With this, we can compare those just above and just below to get the treatment effect. We saw how we could do that with weighted linear regression using a kernel and how this even gave us, for free, standard errors for our ATE.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then, we look at what would happen in the fuzzy RD design, where we have non compliance. We saw how we could approach the situation much like we did with IV.\n",
